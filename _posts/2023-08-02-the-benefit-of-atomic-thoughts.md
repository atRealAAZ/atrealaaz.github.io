Imagine molecules. 

Are you imagining them? You must be. You are made up of them. 

And the funny part is that in the imagining of molecules, molecules are involved. How poetic, that the conceptualization of something is realzed by that same thing. 

And not just in imagining them. Every process in your body uses it. 

And not just your body. Everything around you, everything in the universe, all of existence is built up out of this, from the biggest star to the tallest building to the Large Hadron Collider to your cat (who btw is a dick, don't be fooled), all possible with only 118 atoms, the building blocks of reality. 

The beauty of molecules is that with only 4 basic atoms (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen), and perhaps a few more exotic ones strewn in, all of life in history, with its infinite variation is possible. 

And did you know that if you take the chemical symbols for the four most common elements in the human body and rearrange them, you spell NaCHO? Yeah, if that doesn't prove we live in a simulation or we are the experiment of some hypernatural entities that got bored, I don't know what does. 

(Ok you probably looked it up and realized that it is actually NCHO. But hey, Na (Sodium, such a weird abbreviation) is also important in our bodies, so hey, close enough.)

Or think about language. All the books, all the speeches that have ever been written and used to mobilize the masses for good and bad, or the few words that have been spoken that meant the world to you or hurt you to your core. All possible, all constructed with a meager 26 (!) letters. (Just conveniently forgetting all the other languages that exist or have existed, but had languages not evolved all thought would have been possible with just the Latin script.) 

Do you see a pattern here? The idea is that from a select few atomic units, a gigantic variation can be created. Now imagine... you could do the same with your thoughts. What grand structures could be created.

But wait, this is possible! 

How? 

The Zettelkasten method. By writing each thought down as its own atomic unit you can combine them into molecules of ideas. Each thought can be recombined in almost infinite ways with literally every other thought you ever head, making them have sex to create beautiful new idea babies. 

It is quite simple. You find a resource of your choice, which allows you to link your thoughts, and you start writing away. 

And watch as you create a giant latticework, an organism that lives out the life of your vision.
