Hello there, if you are reading this apparently you are interested in who I am - since you're reading the About section - or you just happened to accidentally somehow land here; in which case, no worries. 

Welcome! 

This is my latest writing 'project'. I started writing structurally when I broke my ankle in February 2016, and was confined to a 2m x 1m bed for a few weeks. Being bored spitless I just started writing some random stuff on my laptop and I discovered that I actually liked the process of writing down my thoughts and sharing them. This was the beginning of a journey that culminated in me winning a university writing competition after which I was the official university columnist for a year. After my term was over I've not written regularly, occasionally banging out a column and sharing it when the moment struck, but writing never truly let me go, so this is the latest attempt of getting back into that flow.

About myself, I enjoy learning new things and gaining novel experiences, of which this blog is the latest example.

If anything in here vibes with you don't hesitate to reach out! I'm always open to meeting new people.
