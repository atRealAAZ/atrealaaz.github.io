Are you a curious person? Are you always eager to meet new people, to hear their stories? There is always more people out there to meet, no matter how often you go out or how many events you attend. There always is a silent majority of people you will never meet. But what if you were to meet every person alive? And not just meet them, but have a night of conversation with them, to find out what their life is like, what their story is. Would it be possible? Let's find out. 

As of this writing there are 7.9 billion walking around (or sitting/sleeping/whatever) on this Earth. (Almost another milestone, I remember as a kid it was 'just' 6 billion for a long time but now it's going in jumps). Let's assume that this is now your life goal so you're willing to spend the rest of your life on it. Since this is your life goal you need no holiday. This means 7.9 billion divided by 365 = 21.643.835. So I'm 30 now, and I thought that was old, but when this little quest finishes you would be 21 *million*. Imagine this. "Hey how old are you by the way?" "Oh I'm 21 million". "Aah the 21 million mark. They say 21 million is the new 20 million 999 thousand and 990!" So, this is not feasible obviously. You need to be quicker. 

Since you can't talk an entire evening with everyone, you decide to have a short conversation, lets say 15 minutes, so you are still able to drill deep. And you decide that doing it at night is not enough, you'll do it the entire day. Since talking to people for the whole day means that you cannot work, you convince some institution to back you financially, say a university, cause it could be interesting to research the effect of knowing 8 billion people on the human psyche. They would pay you to talk to these people every day, and would pay for the cost of the flight ticket of every person, and compensate them for the time they would have to take off work to fly to your country and back. Since downtime means less time spent talking, you decide to streamline the process. This means that some sort of queue will have to be formed in front of your house, consisting of the people that you will talk to next. This means that those people definitely will have to stay in the city. It would be a monumental logistical challenge. Let us further assume that you are committed to this goal, so you do it from 9 - 8, so that you can still relax at night and process it all. You wouldn't need a lunch break, since you can talk while eating. (If all these nationalities would bring some local food this experiment would become more bearable!) 11 hours / 15 minutes = 44 people per day. 7.9 billion divided by 44 ~= 492 000 years. Still too much. That's it, you think. It's impossible. 

You're about to throw the towel in the ring - as the Dutch are wont to say - and are about to schedule the meeting with your university contact to tell them that it's not possible. But then an idea strikes you. So you contact your contact as planned, but you say they must construct an assembly line that will move past your couch. You may not be able to speak to everyone, but at least you'll have *seen* everyone. Hell, and if everyone mentions their name while they move past you on the assembly line and you greet them back, technically this will have constituted a conversation! It would be interesting to see how many names you remember afterward. Let's assume you have 50 years left. Since you're motivated about this goal you will take no more vacation, since meeting everyone will give you all the relaxation you need. 50 years * 365 days = 18250 days left. This means you have to see 432.876 people every day. Assuming you are awake from 9 to 8, and your lunch is done in front of the assembly line, you have to see 432876/11/3600 = 11 people per second. Assuming every person has a 1m width on the assembly line, the speed of this assembly line would be 11m/s = 11 * 3600 / 1000 = 40km/h. So there you have it! It would be possible to talk to 7.9 billion people in your lifetime. All it requires is an elaborately constructed assembly line, a logistical miracle, and a shit-ton of money. But there is a problem. This means you have *just* talked to 7.9 billion people. But in 50 years some of those people that you talked to are dead, and new ones will have been born. So, to be able to say that you have talked to every person *alive*, you have to take those facts into account. 

So you decide, that you aim for a point in which you have talked to the entire population alive. https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/please-exercises-1-4-give-good-rating-previous-page-equation-3-bottom-page-q53142603 Even though it will not last long, because every second four new people are born, and two die. 

```ruby
class World:
    
    def __init__(self, population, growth_rate, mortality_rate):
        self.population = population
        self.growth_rate = growth_rate
        self.mortality_rate = mortality_rate
        
    def evolve(self, years):
        for year in range(1, years):
            self.population += (
                self._transform_rate(self.growth_rate) - 
                self._transform_rate(self.mortality_rate)
            )
            print(self.population)
        return self.population
        
    def _transform_rate(self, rate):
        return self.population/1000 * rate
    
w = World(7.9E9, 18.1, 7.7)
w.evolve(50)
```

But at least for a moment (literally) you will have known... everyone. "Do you know this person" will be a pointless question, because you will know them. "Do you know..." "Yes", you interrupt. "But I didn't finish my sentence!" "Doesn't matter, I know them". Every time you hear a gossip, from anyone, you'll be like.. "ah i know this person!" Every person that has a problem, you'll be like... "I know the perfect person to solve this for you" Your network will be huge. Not just huge, literally all-encompassing. I occasionally hear people say his/her network is huge. Well, now you are a step above that. How would you call that? Your network is full? All-encompassing? You would be able to meet your theoretical perfect match on this planet. Assuming she/he is not already accounted for. You could pick and choose your best friends. Your best matches. Would be interesting. But also a strange experience, to know literally everyone. And to have everyone know you. You would be a supercelebrity, a hyperstar, more so than current celebrities who are limited to the Western world, because literally everyone on this planet would know who you are. Everytime you go shopping, or for a walk you'd see acquaintances everywhere. No. everywhere there would be acquaintances. Or if you go to the biggest gathering of people possible, to a stadium, EVERYONE would know you. You'd be like, are they watching me or the match? Would also be quite tiring. If you meet someone you know you have a quick chat, but to have to do this with literally everyone you pass? Quite difficult. Everytime you walk on a bus, all those eyes staring at you, knowingly. You know that feeling when you get on a bus and you recognize someone, but you have no desire to talk to that person so you pretend to not notice them and go sit somewhere else? Well good luck, wherever you're going to sit you're going to know them. So superfame would not actually be a nice thing. Anonymity is valuable, it turns out.
